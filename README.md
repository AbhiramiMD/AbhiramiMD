👋 Hello! I'm Abhirami MD, a budding data analyst eager to dive into the world of data and analytics.

📊 As a recent post graduate in Economics, with a passion for numbers and problem-solving, I've embarked on a journey to explore the vast landscape of data analysis. 
   Through hands-on projects and coursework, I've gained foundational skills in data manipulation, statistical analysis, and data visualization.

💻 In my projects, I've utilized tools like Excel, Tableau, Power BI and SQL to wrangle and analyze data, uncovering insights that drive decision-making. 
   From exploring datasets to creating insightable visual dashboards, each project has been a stepping stone in my journey to becoming a proficient data analyst.

🔍 While I may be new to the field, I bring enthusiasm, a hunger for learning, and a fresh perspective to every project I undertake. 
   I'm eager to collaborate, learn from experienced professionals, and contribute to impactful data-driven solutions.

🚀 Outside of my data endeavors, I enjoy Books and Podcasts, which often fuel my creativity and analytical thinking.

📫 Let's connect and explore how I can bring my passion for data analysis to your team and contribute to meaningful projects!
